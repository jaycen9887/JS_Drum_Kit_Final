# JS_Drum_Kit_Final
Simple JavaScript, keyboard input drum kit

This web based app allows you to use the a,s,d,f,g,h,j,k, and l keys to create specific sounds associated with each key. 

I created this while learning via an online course. This was the final product of the site. 

If you have any suggestions on any features to add or any changes that need to be made please let me know as I would enjoy the challenge.
